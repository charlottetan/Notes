Basics Borg admits, schedules, starts, restarts, and monitors the full range of applications that Google runs. Borg runs mainly two types of workloads, long-running server jobs and batch jobs. A cluster lives inside a datacenter and hosts a Borg cell with median size of 10k heterogenous machines. A Borg task maps to a set of Linux processes running in a container on a machine. Borg uses quota for admission control and priority for scheduling. Borg name service(BNS) writes task's hostname and port to Chubby so RPC system can find task endpoint. Architecture A Borg cell has a logically centralized controller Borgmaster and each machine has an agent process Borglet. Borgmaster consists of two processes: the main Borgmaster process handles client RPCs, manages state machines and communicates with Borglets, the scheduler process assigns tasks to machines with feasibility checking and scoring. The Borgmaster is replicated five times and each replica records states in the Paxos store on local disks. Borgmaster keeps checkpoints(periodic snapshots plus change log) in the Paxos store. Borglet starts/stops tasks and manages local resources. Borgmaster periodically polls Borglets for current state and sends requests. The elected master is responsible for preparing messages to Borglets and updating the cell's state. For performance scalability each Borgmaster runs a stateless link shard to handle the communication with some Borglets. Features Scalability To handle larger cells, split scheduler into a separate process so it can run in parallel with other Borgmaster functions. Use separate threads to talk to Borglets and shard functions across Borgmaster replicas. Cache scores until machine/task properties change. Ignore small changes to reduce cache invalidation. Instead of examining all machines, scheduler examines machines in random order until it finds enough feasible machines to score. Availability Automatically reschedules evicted tasks. Reduce correlated failures by spreading tasks of a job across failure domains. Use declarative desired-state representations and idempotent mutating operations. Already-running tasks continue even if the Borgmaster or the task's Borglet goes down. Isolation Security isolation is implemented with Linux chroot jail. Performance isolation is implemented with Linux control groups(cgroups). When running out of non-compressible resources(memory, disk, etc), the Borglet terminates task from low priority to high.

Background There is a need for streaming computation models that can scale transparently to large clusters, where faults and stragglers are inevitable. Most existing systems are based on continuous operator model(like Storm). The stateful nature of operators and nondeterminism of records make it hard to provide efficient fault recovery. Two main approaches, replication(2x hardware) or upstream backup(long replay time), are both expensive. Neither approach handles stragglers -- in replication, synchronization protocols slow both down replicas; in upstream backup, a straggler must be treated as a failure. We seek a system design with scalability to hundreds of nodes, minimal cost, second-scale latency and second-scale fault/straggler recovery. Discretized Streams D-Stream model treats a streaming computation as a series of deterministic batch computations on small time intervals. Users define programs by manipulating D-Stream objects; a D-Stream is a sequence of RDDs. The consistency semantics are clear because time is naturally discretized into intervals and each interval's output RDDs reflect all inputs received up to that interval. D-Streams place records into input datasets based on the time when each records arrives at the system. Grouping records by external timestamps is not natively supported. System Architecture Spark Streaming consists of three components, (1) a master to track D-Stream lineage and schedules tasks, (2) worker nodes to receive/store/process data and computed RDDs and (3) a client library to send data into system. To decide when to process a new interval, nodes synchronize clocks via NTP and send the master a list of received block IDs in each interval when it ends. The master then starts launching tasks for that interval without further synchronization. Spark Streaming divides computations into short, stateless, deterministic tasks, each of which may run on any node in the cluster. Moving computations to another machine is hard in traditional streaming systems with rigid topologies. To support streaming, Spark Streaming implements changes/optimizations like timestep pipelining, lineage cutoff, master recovery, etc. Fault and Straggler Recovery Parallel recovery: when a node fails, the state RDD partitions and running tasks on that node can be recomputed in parallel on other nodes.

Background Data systems are categorized as primary and derived data stores. A requirement from derived data stores is to capture, flow and process primary data changes. There are two families of solutions, (1) application-driven dual writes that lets application writes multiple data systems in parallel and (2) database log mining that extracts changes from primary data store's transaction log. We choose (2) because it avoids complex coordination protocol for consistency and has single source-of-truth. Architecture Overview Logical Components: fetcher to extract changes, log store to cache change stream, snapshot store to store a moving snapshot of change stream and subscription client to pull changes and surface them to applications. relay process = fetcher + in-memory log store bootstrap service = persistent log store + snapshot store Databus is externally-clocked. Each change set is annotated with a monotonically-increasing system change number (SCN) assigned by data source. Databus favors pull over push model because we need to keep SCN timelines for a large number consumers and it simplifies error handling. Relay The changes extracted by fetcher are serialized into binary format independent of sources (Avro). They are grouped within transaction boundaries, annotated with SCN and buffered in the transient log. The relay does not maintain consumer-related states. Subscription client maintains progress checkpoint and and pass on each pull request. To deploy a cluster of processes, we can let either (1) all relays independently connecting the data source or (2) one relay as leader and the rest followers pull changes from the leader. The change data is stored in a long-lived in-memory circular buffer using the on-wire serialization format. This enables high-throughput bulk-writes when serving pull requests and minimizes GC pressure (performance variance). The trade-off here is on-wire format needs more CPU resources for filtering. A skip list index is implemented on top of the buffer to efficiently serve pull requests to scan changes from a particular SCN. Consistency windows are marked explicitly so consumers can differentiate the cases of no updates and of no updates matching the filter. The end-of-window markers can also contain additional metadata like checksums. Bootstrap Service For consumers fallen behind a lot, it is more efficient to catch up with a snapshot of compacted changes, i.e. only the latest state of affected rows. Bootstrap service database has a persistent log store and a snapshot store because: New changes are applied to the snapshot store while the consumer applications are reading (it is not practical to lock the snapshot store), so bootstrap service will replay changes after the snapshot read started for consistency. It ensures bootstrap service has enough write throughput to keep up the data source since appending to the log store is much cheaper than building the snapshot store.","title":"databus"},{"location":"databus/databus/#databus-linkedins-scalable-consistent-change-data-capture-platform","text":"A source-agnostic distributed change data capture system of LinkedIn's data processing pipeline.","title":"Databus: Linkedin\u2019s Scalable Consistent Change Data Capture Platform"},{"location":"databus/databus/#background","text":"Data systems are categorized as primary and derived data stores.

Basics MySQL can't to meet scalability and reliability requirements as it is hard to scale up and rebalance. F1 is built on Spanner, which provides scalable data storage, synchronous replication, strong consistency and ordering properties. F1 has higher latency for typical reads and writes, so many techniques(even a new ORM layer) are used to hide the latency. Architecture F1 servers are typically co-located in the datacenters as the Spanner servers storing the data. F1 servers can communicate with Spanner servers outside their own datacenters for availability and load balancing. Shared slave pool consists of F1 processes to execute distributed query plans. F1 master monitors slave process health and distributes the list of available slaves to F1 servers. Features Hierarchical Schema Logically, tables in the F1 schema can be organized into a hierarchy. Physically, F1 stores each child table clustered with and interleaved within the rows from its parent table(the child table must have a foreign key to its parent table as a prefix of its primary key). Reading all AdGroups for a Customer can be expressed as a single range read. Hierarchical clustering is useful for updates since it reduces the number of Spanner groups involved in a transaction. Flat schema is possible, but hierarchy matching data semantics is beneficial(most transactions update data for a single advertiser). Non-blocking Schema Changes A schema change algorithm that: Enforcing across all F1 servers, at most twoschemas(\"current\" and \"next\") are active. Dividing schema change into multiple phases where consecutive pair of phases are compatible and cannot cause anomalies. Optimistic Transaction F1 implements three types of transactions: snapshot(read-only). pessimistic(Spanner transaction that requires lock). optimistic(arbitrary long read phase without lock + short write phase with lock). Benefits: tolerating misbehaved clients, long-lasting transactions, server-side retriability, server failover, speculative writes. Drawbacks: insertion phantoms, low throughput under high contentions. Change History Every transaction creates ChangeBatch protocol buffers and they are written to change history tables that exist as children of root tables. Change History can be used to trigger incremental processing when root rows change or update cache. Query Processing F1 supports both centralized and distributed execution of queries. Centralized execution is for OLTP queries and runs on one F1 server. Distributed execution is for OLAP queries and spreads workload in the slave pool. F1 mainly uses remote data source, so it optimizes to reduce network latency with batching or pipelining data access(example: Lookup Join operator), while traditional database optimizes to reduce disk latency. F1 operators stream data as much as possible at the cost of not preserving data orders. F1 uses only hash partitioning. Range partitioning is infeasible because Spanner applies random partitioning.

Introduction Many computation tasks are conceptually straightforward, but given the size of input data, the computations have to be distributed across machines to finish in a reasonable amount of time. MapReduce is an abstraction that can express many computation tasks while hiding details of parallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution and load balancing. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Execution A single master assigns tasks to workers; there are M map tasks and R reduce tasks in total. For map task, worker reads input, applies user-defined Map function and periodically writes intermediate results buffered in memory to local disk. For reduce task, worker uses rpcs to read intermediate results on map workers' local disks, sorts intermediate results to group occurrences of the same key, applies user-defined Reduce function and writes final results to a global file system. Master is responsible of propagating the locations of intermediate files from map tasks to reduce tasks. Fault Tolerance For worker failure, master periodically pings workers and marks the worker that has no response for a certain amount of time as failed. Completed map tasks and any in-progress tasks on that worker are rescheduled to other workers; no need to re-execute completed reduce tasks because output is stored in global file system instead of worker's local disk.

Background Other streaming systems do not provide the combination of fault tolerance, versatility and scalability. A monotonically increasing low watermark, which indicates all data up to a given timestamp has been received, is useful to distinguish whether there is no data or data is delayed. System Overview MillWheel is a graph of user-define transformations on input data that produces output data. Inputs/outputs are represented by (key, value, timestamp) triples. User code can access a per-key, per-computation persistent state for per-key aggregation. Delivery Guarantee: all internal updates within the MillWheel framework resulting from record processing are atomically checkpointed per-key and records are delivered exactly-once. Concepts A computation subscribes to zero or more input streams and publishes one or more output streams. Persistent states are per-key opaque byte strings stored in Bigtable/Spanner. Consumer specifies per-stream key extraction functions. Computation code(containing application logic) is invoked upon receipt of input data. Processing is serialized per-key but can be parallelized over distinct keys. Low watermark of a computation A is defined as min(oldest work of A, low watermark of C: C outputs to A)\u200b. Low watermark values are seeded by injectors that send data into MillWheel from external systems. Fault Tolerance Delivery Guarantee System assigns unique IDs to all records at production time. Upon receipt of an input record, MillWheel checks the record against deduplication data(bloom filter + backing store). For strong productions, MillWheel checkpoints produced records before delivery in the same atomic write as state modification. When a process restarts, the checkpoints are scanned into memory and replayed. For weak productions, MillWheel broadcasts downstream deliveries optimistically prior to persisting state. MillWheel selectively checkpoints a small percentage of straggler productions to prevent them from occupying undue resources in the sender. State Manipulation To avoid inconsistencies in persistent state, all per-key updates are wrapped in a single atomic operation. To address zombie writers and stale writes in network, MillWheel guarantees that for a given key, only a single worker can write to that key at a particular point in time. It is implemented by attaching a sequencer token to each write and let backing store check for validity. Single-writer guarantee is critical to state consistency and low watermark correctness. System Implementation A replicated master divides each computation into a set of owned lexicographical key intervals and assigns intervals to a set of machines. It can move/split/merge intervals.

Background Current distributed computing frameworks(like MapReduce) lack abstractions for leveraging distributed memory, so they are inefficient for applications that need to reuse intermediate results(iterative machine learning, interactive data mining, etc). Current abstractions for cluster in-memory storage(like Piccolo) provide interface with fine-grained updates. They have to replicate data or log updates across machines for fault tolerance, which is expensive for data-intensive workloads. RDD Model An RDD is a read-only, partitioned collection of records. RDDs can only be created through deterministic operations on (1) data in stable storage or (2) other RDDs. RDD provides interface based on coarse-grained transformations that apply the same operation to many data items, which allows efficient fault tolerance by logging the transformations used to build a dataset(lineage) rather than actual data. RDD is not suitable for applications that needs to make asynchronous fine-grained updates to shared states(incremental web crawler, etc). Implementation An RDD is represented as (1) a set of partitions, (2) a set of dependencies of parent RDDs, (3) a function for computing the dataset from parents and (4) metadata about partitioning scheme and data placement.

Basics Storm data processing architecture consists of streams of tuples flowing through topologies. A topology is a directed graph where vertices represent computation and edges represent the data flow. Storm is used by groups inside Twitter like revenue, user services, search and content discovery. Most of topologies have <3 stages. Storm runs on distributed cluster like Mesos, uses ZooKeeper to keep state and pulls data from queues like Kafka. Architecture Overview Clients submit topologies to Nimbus, the master node of Storm. Nimbus distributes and coordinates the execution of topologies on worker nodes. Each worker node runs a Supervisor, which receives assignment from Nimbus and monitors the health of workers. Each worker node runs one or more worker processes. Each work process runs a JVM, in which it runs one or more executors made of tasks. Worker process serve as containers on host machines. Tasks provide intra-bolt/intra-spout parallelism and executors provide intra-topology parallelism. Nimbus Nimbus is a Thrift service. Topologies are Thrift objects. Nimbus stores topologies in ZooKeeper and Jar files of user codes on local disk of the Nimbus machine. Nimbus and Supervisor are fail-fast and stateless. States are kept in ZooKeeper or local disks. Workers Each worker has two dedicated threads, a worker receive thread and a worker send thread, to route incoming and outgoing tuples. User logic thread runs actual task for input tuples and places output tuples to output queue. Executor send thread checks the task identifier of tuples in output queue and writes them to corresponding input queue(destination is same worker) or global transfer queue. Processing Semantics Storm provides two processing semantics, \"at least once\" and \"at most once\". \"At least once\" is done by an \"acker\" bolt.

Background The content Facebook presents to each user is highly tailored, so we have to perform filtering and aggregation when the content is viewed instead of when the content is created. Facebook was originally built with MySQL/PHP/memcache. This look-aside key-value cache architecture has problems like inefficient edge lists, distributed control logic and expensive read-after-write consistency. TAO is designed to handle the workload of read-mostly access to a constantly changing graph. Efficiency and availability are explicitly favored over consistency. Data Model and API Object:(id) -> (otype, (key -> value)) Association: (id1, atype, id2) -> (time, (key -> value)*) Association List: (id1, atype) -> [a1, a2, ..., an] Objects are typed nodes. Each object has a globally unique id. Associations are typed directed edges between objects; at most one association can exist between two objects. Both objects and associations may contain data as key->value pairs. Bidirectional edges are modeled as two associations. TAO keeps associations in sync with their inverses. TAO's association queries are organized around association lists(associations in descending order by the \"time\" field). A per-atype upper bound for each query is enforced( assoc_ranage(id1, atype, pos, limit) ), so the client must issue multiple queries to enumerate a longer association list. Architecture Basics TAO uses MySQL as persistent storage. Data is divided into logical shards and each database server is responsible for one or more shards. Each object id has an embedded shard_id(fixed for entire lifetime). An association is stored on the shard of its id1. Multiple caching servers together form a tier. Shards are mapped onto cache servers with consistent hashing. The TAO in-memory cache contains objects, association lists and association counts. Cache servers understand the semantics of the contents and can use them to answer queries not processed before(example: cache count zero for range query). Client issues requests directly to the appropriate cache server, which will complete the read/write request(contact other cache servers/databases if necessary). For write operation on an association with inverse, the cache server for id1 will contact the cache server for id2 and issue write to database after the inverse write is complete. TAO does not provide atomicity between two updates; hanging associations are repaired by an asynchronous job. Scaling Leader and Follower Tiers Larger tiers are problematic because they are prone to hot spots and have O(N^2) growth in all-to-all connections. We split the cache into two levels: a leader tier and multiple follow tiers. Leaders behave as the basic case, while followers will instead forward read misses and writes to leaders. To keep cache consistent, leaders asynchronously send cache maintenance messages to followers. A version number in message allows it to be ignored when arriving late. Geographically Cluster data center locations into a few regions where the intra-region latency is small. Store one copy of the social graph per region. Followers behave identically in all regions, forwarding read misses and writes to the local region's tier leader. Leaders query the local region's database regardless of whether master or slave. Writes are forwarded by the local leader to the leader in the master region. Master region is controlled separately for each shard and is automatically switched to recover from database failure. We prefer to locate all of the master databases in a single region, otherwise inverse write may introduce inter-region latency. Consistency After a write, TAO guarantees the eventual delivery of an invalidation or refill to all tiers. TAO reads marked as critical will be proxied to the master region for stronger consistency. Fault Tolerance Database failures: When a master database is down, one of its slave is promoted to be the new master. When a slave database is down, cache misses are redirected to leaders in the master region. Leader failures: Followers reroute read misses directly to the database and writes to a random replacement leader. Invalidation and refill failures: If a follower is unreachable, leader persists messages and redeliver them later. If these messages are lost due to permanent leader failure, a bulk invalidation operation is used to invalidate all data of specific shard in followers.

Basics ZooKeeper provides a coordination kernel for clients to implement primitives for configuration, group membership, leader election and distributed lock. ZooKeeper implements non-blocking API, so a client can have multiple outstanding operations at a time. ZooKeeper guarantees FIFO client ordering for all operations and linearizable writes. ZooKeeper target workload read to write ration is 2:1 to 100:1. Service Overview znode ZooKeeper provides the abstraction of a set of data nodes(znodes) organized by hierarchical namespaces. znodes are in-memory data node stored in ZooKeeper. A znode can be regular or ephemeral(automatically removed when corresponding session terminates). znodes are not for general data storage. Instead, they are used to store metadata or configuration of applications(typically 1MB). Client API ZooKeeper provides API for client to manipulating znodes like in a file system. For read methods, ZooKeeper implements watches to allow client to receive notification of changes. Watches are one-time triggers associated with a session(for example, getData(path, watch) ). For write methods, ZooKeeper accepts an optional expected version number(for example, setData(path, data, version) ). If set, the write succeeds only if the actual version number of znode matches the expected one. ZooKeeper client maintains session with ZooKeeper through heartbeat messages. Implementation ZooKeeper service comprises an ensemble of servers that each has replicated ZooKeeper data. One is leader and the rest are followers. Read requests are handled locally at each server, so it may return stale data since some committed transactions are not applied on that server yet. Write requests are forwarded to leader. Leader (1) calculates the new system state to transform write requests into idempotent transactions and (2) broadcast the state changes to other servers through atomic broadcast protocol ZAB. ZooKeeper uses TCP so message order is maintained by network. ZooKeeper uses replay log and periodic snapshots for recoverability. ZooKeeper state is not locked when taking the snapshot, but idempotent transactions can be applied twice as long as in order.","title":"zookeeper"},{"location":"zookeeper/zookeeper/#zookeeper-wait-free-coordination-for-internet-scale-systems","text":"A service for coordinating processes of distributed applications.","title":"ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems"},{"location":"zookeeper/zookeeper/#basics","text":"ZooKeeper provides a coordination kernel for clients to implement primitives for configuration, group membership, leader election and distributed lock.
